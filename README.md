# Conflunet_Kafka_POC
This project demonstrates an ELT process using Confluent Kafka. It extracts facial data (age, gender, expression) from a webcam with Python's DeepFace library, sends it via Kafka Producer, consumes it with Kafka Consumer, and displays real-time statistics on a Streamlit web page.
